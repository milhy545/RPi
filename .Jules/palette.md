## 2026-06-19 - Added ARIA labels to web UI icon-only buttons
**Learning:** Found several icon-only buttons (like ⏸, ⏹, ⏪10, 10⏩, 🔉, 🔊, 🔇, and CEC navigation buttons) lacking `aria-label`s, rendering them unreadable to screen readers.
**Action:** Always verify that buttons containing only symbols or emojis have descriptive `aria-label` attributes.
